# passman
A simple password manager made in Python using sqlite3.

## Requirements
â€¢ Python 3.8+

## Installation
First clone or download the source code, open a terminal window in the source code folder and then execute this command to install the dependencies.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
To run the program, run `.\passman-main.py`

## GUI
Use the `gui-version` branch for the GUI version.

## Encryption
None, you can access the passwords through the stored .db file. The only "encryption" which might be present is the laziness of the person trying to get your passwords as the db file is not out in the open and is stored in another folder.
