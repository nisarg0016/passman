# passman
A simple password manager made in Python using sqlite3.

## No GUI :)
The CLI version is much safer as it interacts directly to the with Python and the console rather than interacting through a module and then with the other platforms.
Making a GUI in Python is anyways not advisable and making a GUI in Java or C# is out of syllabus. [Here](https://youtu.be/BgxklT94W0I?t=179) is a video of a world renown Python developer talking about it.

## Safety
Nice joke. No encryption for life.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+
pip

## Installation
```
pip install requirements.txt
python passman-main.py
```

BEWARE, IT USES SQLITE3 :) :)
